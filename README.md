# IP-Sweep : Just a Rather "Normal" project

This is a mini project, that sweeps up all the IP address in :
~~~
1) Whole IP-Address in a Range (For Example : from 192.168.0.1 to the last ip)
2) IP Address Range in a Network
~~~
## Use :
~~~
1) Enable executable functions for by : chmod +x ipsweep.sh
2) Check IP by ifconfig/ipconfig in Linux or Windows. Put the IP, and leave the last address digit.
3)./ipsweep.sh <ip-address range> {Syntax : ./ipsweep.sh 192.168.0.) and leave it till here.
